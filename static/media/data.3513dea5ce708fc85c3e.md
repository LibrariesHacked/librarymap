# Data

This website displays data on mobile library stops, and static libraries, across the UK. It does this by merging data into a common format (called a schema).

- Explore the schema definition for [static library locations](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries)
- Explore the schema definition for [mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops)

## Data sources

The website was created by transforming data from the following sources:

- Scottish public libraries from the [Scottish Library & Information Council](https://scottishlibraries.org/find-a-library/)
- Wales public libraries held in Wikidata and displayed on [Libraries Wales](https://libraries.wales/)
- Northern Ireland libraries and mobile library stops from [Libraries NI](https://www.librariesni.org.uk/Libraries/)
- Various mobile library stops from library service websites

## Maintaining data

The best option for shared library data is for services to maintain their own data, and publish it as open data in a standard format. That way it can be used for a variety of applications. Open data has also long been the established policy across both central and local government.

### Instructions for libraries

1. Check out the data schemas for [static library locations](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries) and/or [mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops). Please feel free to get in contact for help.
2. Your data should be be published online as a CSV (comma separated values) file.
3. The data should be be publicly accessible to everyone. This could be through links on the library website, council open data pages, or library catalogue.
4. The data should be published using an open licence. The [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) is suggested for local government data.

Send an email to [info@librarieshacked.org](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) with the details above, and the site will be updated to use your data source. When you make updates to the data, they will be updated on this site the following day.
