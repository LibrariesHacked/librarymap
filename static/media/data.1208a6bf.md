## Data

This site is designed to display library data that is in a standard data format (called a schema).

* Schema for [data on libraries](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries)
* Schema for [data on mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops)

### Initial data sources

The website was created using the following data sources:

* Scottish public libraries from the SLIC
* Wales public libraries from Wikidata
* Northern Ireland libraries and mobile library stops from Libraries NI
* Various mobile library stops from each individual library service website

### Updating data

Library services can maintain their own data, and store it online where they think best. The following are the requirements for library services to set this up.

* The data should conform to the relevant spreadsheet schema for [libraries](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries), or [mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops). Help is available if necessary in getting this set up.
* The data should be published online as a CSV (comma separated values) file.
* The data should be be publicly accessible and findable. This could be through links on the library website, council open data pages, or online catalogue
* The data must be published using an open licence. The [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) is suggested for all data.

Send an email to [info@librarieshacked.org](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) with the details above, and the site can then be set up to be maintained using that data source. When you make updates to the data they will be reflected on this site.
