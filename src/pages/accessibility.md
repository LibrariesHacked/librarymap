# Accessibility

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

This website is in development and being used as a prototype to demonstrate a UK-wide library lookup service. During this time it is being tested for accessibility issues. This is being done using Government Digital Service guidelines [doing a basic accessibility check](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one).

The map pages uses maps to explore static and mobile library stops. Although maps are difficult to make accessible, we are looking at making sure the information presented by the map is also available in other formats. The main home page provides a search which provides access to the same library information.

If you do experience any problems using this website, please raise these and [send us an email](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org).
