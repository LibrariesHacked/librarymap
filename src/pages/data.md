# Data

This website is designed to display data on mobile library stops, and static libraries, from across the UK. It does this by utlising data in a common format, with the same data columns and types (called a schema).

- Explore the schema for [data on static library locations](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries)
- Explore the schema for [data on mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops)

## Initial data sources

The website was created by transforming data from the following data sources:

- Scottish public libraries from the [Scottish Library & Information Council]([https://scottishlibraries.org/find-a-library/)
- Wales public libraries held in Wikidata and displayed on [libraries.wales](https://libraries.wales/)
- Northern Ireland libraries and mobile library stops from [Libraries NI](https://www.librariesni.org.uk/Libraries/Pages/libraries-home.aspx)
- Various mobile library stops from each individual library service website

## Maintaining data

The best chance for having standardised library data is for library services to maintain their own data and publish it as open data. That way it can be combined and used for a variety of applications, this website being just one of them. Open data publishing has also long been the established policy for both central and local government organisations.

Library services are able to maintain their own data, and publish it where they think best.

1. Check out the data schemas for [static library locations](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries) and/or [mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops). Please feel free to get in contact for help with these.
2. Your data should be be published online in CSV (comma separated values) format.
3. The data should be be publicly accessible to everyone. This could be through links on the library website, council open data pages, or library catalogue.
4. The data should be published using an open licence. The [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) is suggested for local government data.

Send an email to [info@librarieshacked.org](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) with the details above, and the site will be updated to use your data source. When you make updates to the data, they will be updated on this site by the following day.
