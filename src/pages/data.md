# Data

This website displays data on mobile library timetables, and static libraries. It does this by combining different data sources into a common format (called a schema). You can explore the schema definition for [library locations](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries) as well as [mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops).

## Data sources

We used data from the following sources:

- The [basic dataset for libraries](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-arts-museums-and-libraries/supporting-libraries) in England from the Arts Council
- Scottish public libraries from the [Scottish Library & Information Council](https://scottishlibraries.org/find-a-library/)
- Wales public libraries held in Wikidata and displayed on [Libraries Wales](https://libraries.wales/)
- Northern Ireland libraries and mobile library stops from [Libraries NI](https://www.librariesni.org.uk/Libraries/)
- Various mobile library stops from library service websites

## Maintaining data

An up-to-date directory of library locations is only possible if individual services maintain their own data, and publish it for open reuse.

### Instructions for libraries

There are currently two options for library service to maintain data.

#### Option 1: Publish your own data

1. Check out the [static library locations](https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries) and/or [mobile library stops](https://schema.librarydata.uk/mobile-library-stops) data formats. Please feel free to get in contact for help creating data.
2. Your data should be be published online as a CSV (comma separated values) spreadsheet file.
3. The data should be be publicly accessible to everyone. For example, this could be links on the library website, council open data pages, or library catalogue.
4. The data should be published using an open licence, such as the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Send an email to [info@librarieshacked.org](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org) with the details above, and the site will be updated to use your data source.

#### Option 2: Maintain the existing data

1. Go to https://create.librarydata.uk/ and enter using your organisation email address. You'll receive an email providing a login link.
2. The [Libraries pages](https://create.librarydata.uk/libraries) provides a data editing tool where you can edit the details of any library in your library service.
3. Choose your library service and update the data. You must be logged in to do this.
4. Ensure you fully complete the process by selecting to Publish the data.

Updates should be visible on this site the next day.
